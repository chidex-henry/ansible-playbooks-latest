## Project: Deploying a Static Website on AWS with Ansible

### Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a static website on AWS using Ansible and AWS EC2 instances. Ansible, a robust IT automation system, facilitates configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. The project utilizes a reference architecture to construct a three-tier AWS network VPC from scratch. Key AWS services deployed include VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, Security Groups, EC2 Instance connect endpoint, ALB, and Route 53.

### Reference Architecture Summary

1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Configuration**:
    - Created VPC with public and private subnets across two availability zones.
    - Deployed an Internet Gateway for connectivity between VPC instances and the Internet.
    - Implemented Security Groups for network firewall management.

2. **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**:
    - Utilized two Availability Zones for enhanced reliability.
    - Positioned infrastructure components strategically across public and private subnets.

3. **EC2 Instance Configuration**:
    - Employed EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint for secure connections.
    - Hosted the website on EC2 instances placed within private subnets.
    - Enabled internet access for instances in private subnets via NAT Gateway.

4. **Deployment with Ansible**:
    - Configured an Ansible server in the private subnet.
    - Launched EC2 instances named webservers across different regions.
    - Tested connectivity between Ansible server and webservers using keypairs.
    - Stored Ansible Playbooks on GitHub for configuration management.
    - Created Ansible Inventory file to manage nodes.
    - Deployed web setup from Ansible server to webservers using Ansible Playbooks.

5. **Additional Features**:
    - Utilized Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution.
    - Implemented Auto Scaling Group for managing EC2 instances.
    - Secured application communications with Certificate Manager.
    - Configured Simple Notification Service (SNS) for Auto Scaling Group alerts.
    - Registered domain name and set up DNS record with Route 53.

### Commands Used

- **Test Connection Between Ansible Server and Web Servers**:
    - `sudo yum update -y`
    - `sudo yum -y install python-pip`
    - `sudo pip install boto3`

- **Install Ansible on Ansible Server**:
    - `sudo apt update`
    - `sudo apt upgrade`
    - `sudo apt install software-properties-common -y`
    - `sudo apt install ansible -y`
    - `ansible â€“version`

- **Create Ansible Inventory File**:
    ```
    [all:vars]
    ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python2.7
    ```

- **Use Ansible to Ping Web Servers to Test Connection**:
    ```
    ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa -i inventory -m ping -u ec2-user
    ansible all -m ping
    ```

- **Jupiter Website Commands Setup**:
    - Script for Ansible Playbook commands to deploy the website.

     #!/bin/bash: This line indicates that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

    sudo su: Switches the user to the superuser or root user for executing subsequent commands with elevated privileges.

    yum update -y: Updates the package manager and all installed packages without prompting for confirmation (-y flag).

    yum install -y httpd: Installs the Apache HTTP server (httpd) package without prompting for confirmation.

    cd /var/www/html: Changes the current directory to /var/www/html, which is the default web root directory for Apache.

    wget https://github.com/azeezsalu/jupiter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip: Downloads the main.zip file from the specified GitHub repository.

    unzip main.zip: Unzips the downloaded main.zip file, extracting its contents.

    cp -r jupiter-main/* /var/www/html/: Copies the contents of the extracted jupiter-main directory to the Apache web root directory.

    rm -rf jupiter-main main.zip: Removes the jupiter-main directory and the main.zip file to clean up after the deployment.
  
    systemctl enable httpd: Enables the Apache HTTP server to start automatically upon system boot.

    systemctl start httpd: Starts the Apache HTTP server immediately.


  Your bash script appears to automate the installation and setup of an Apache web server along with the deployment of a web application from a GitHub repository. Here's a breakdown of what each line does:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
This line indicates that the script is written in the Bash scripting language.

```bash
sudo su
```
This switches to the root user. However, it might be better to avoid using `sudo su` in scripts and instead run the script itself with root privileges.

```bash
yum update -y
```
This command updates the system packages using the YUM package manager.

```bash
yum install -y httpd
```
This command installs the Apache HTTP server (httpd).

```bash
cd /var/www/html
```
This changes the current directory to `/var/www/html`, where the web server's files are typically served from.

```bash
wget https://github.com/azeezsalu/jupiter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```
This command downloads the zip file containing the web application from the specified GitHub repository.

```bash
unzip main.zip
```
This command extracts the contents of the downloaded zip file.

```bash
cp -r jupiter-main/* /var/www/html/
```
This command copies the extracted contents of the repository into the web server's document root directory (`/var/www/html`), effectively deploying the web application.

```bash
rm -rf jupiter-main main.zip
```
This command removes the extracted directory and the downloaded zip file to clean up after the deployment.

```bash
systemctl enable httpd 
```
This command enables the Apache service to start automatically on system boot.

```bash
systemctl start httpd
```
This command starts the Apache service immediately.

Overall, this script automates the setup of an Apache web server and deploys a web application from a GitHub repository. However, it's important to review and understand each command before running scripts, especially those with administrative privileges like this one. Additionally, ensure that you have the appropriate permissions and backups in place before running such scripts in a production environment.
  

### Conclusion
By following this setup, users can effectively deploy a static website on AWS using Ansible, leveraging automation and infrastructure as code principles for efficient management and scalability. This comprehensive approach ensures robustness, reliability, and ease of maintenance in hosting static web content on AWS infrastructure.
